# Starkers
Originally created by Viewport Industries, Ltd.
Currently maintained by Véronique Bellamy.

## What is Starkers?
Starkers is a bare bones theme for WordPress and is compatible with WordPress 4.9.8. It is created to be a starting point for a theme designer. It's free of all style, presentational elements, and non-semantic markup. In other words, Starkers is a perfect 'blank slate' for all your WordPress projects.

Best of all: it’s free and fully GPL-licensed, so you can use it for whatever you like — even commercial work.

At it's beginning, Starkers has merely been a stripped-back version of the default theme that ships with WordPress, and as a result has never been quite as ‘naked’ as it could be. Elliot Jay Stocks and Keir Whitaker brought it under the Viewport Industries banner and have rebuilt it from the ground up. Literally. Not one line of code was the same.

However, it has been abandoned for many years and Véronique Bellamy is taking it up to keep it compliant with the latest versions of WordPress.

### 4.0 - Monsieur Myriel
After forking this repo and splitting it from Viewpoint's original repo, I applied the changes I've made to this theme over the years. Namely, this brings Starkers compatible with the latest version of WordPress. A point to build on to make Starkers more powerful.
