## Version History
### 4.0 - Monsieur Myriel
After forking this repo and splitting it from Viewpoint's original repo, I applied the changes I've made to this theme over the years. Namely, this brings Starkers compatible with the latest version of WordPress. A point to build on to make Starkers more powerful.

## Former Project Description
Starkers is a bare-bones WordPress theme created to act as a starting point for the theme designer. Free of all style, presentational elements, and non-semantic markup, Starkers is the perfect ‘blank slate’ for all your WordPress projects.

Best of all: it’s free and fully GPL-licensed, so you can use it for whatever you like — even commercial work.

Up until now, Starkers has merely been a stripped-back version of the default theme that ships with WordPress, and as a result has never been quite as ‘naked’ as it could be. Now we’ve brought it under the Viewport Industries banner and have rebuilt it from the ground up. Literally. Not one line of code is the same.
